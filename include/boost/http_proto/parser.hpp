/** A parser for HTTP/1 messages.

    This parser uses a single block of memory allocated
    during construction and guarantees that it will
    never exceed the specified size. This space will be
    reused for parsing multiple HTTP messages (one
    message at a time).

    The allocated space will be utilized for the
    following purposes:

    @li Provide a mutable buffer sequence for reading
        raw input (for example, from a socket).
    @li Storing HTTP headers and provide a non-owning,
        read-only view that allows efficient access and
        iteration through header names and values.
    @li Offering O(1) access to important HTTP headers,
        including the request method, target, and
        response status code.
    @li Storing all or part of an HTTP message and
        provide the necessary interfaces for retrieving
        it.
    @li Taking ownership of user-provided elastic
        buffer and Sink objects.
    @li Storing the necessary state for inflate
        algorithms.

    The parser is strict. Any malformed inputs
    according to the documented HTTP ABNFs is treated
    as an unrecoverable error.
