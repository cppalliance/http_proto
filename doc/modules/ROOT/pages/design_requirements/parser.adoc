= Parser Design Requirements

== Design

=== Comparison to Boost.Beast

This library builds on the experiences learned from Boost.Beast's seven years
of success. Beast brings these unique design strengths:

* Body type named requirements
* First-class message container
* Individual parser and serializer objects

The message container suffers from these problems:

* Templated on the body type.
* Templated on Allocator
* Node-based implementation
* Serialization is too costly

Meanwhile parsers and serializes suffer from these problems:

* Buffer-at-a-time operation is clumsy.
* Objects are not easily re-used
* Parser is a class template because of body types

==== Message Container

In HTTP.Proto the message container implementation always stores the complete
message or fields in its correctly serialized form. Insertions and modifications
are performed in linear time. When the container is reused, the amortized cost
of reallocation becomes zero. A small lookup table is stored past the end of
the serialized message, permitting iteration in constant time.

==== Parser

The HTTP.Proto parser is designed to persist for the lifetime of the connection
or application. It allocates a fixed size memory buffer upon construction and
uses this memory region to perform type-erasure and apply or remove content
encodings to the body. The parser is a regular class instead of a class
template, which greatly improves its ease of use over the Beast parser design.

==== Serializer

As with the parser, the serializer is designed to persist for the lifetime of
the connection or application and also allocates a fixed size buffer.

== Memory Allocation and Memory Utilization

The `parser` must use a single block of memory allocated during construction and
guarantee that it will never exceed the specified size. It should also be able
to reuse this space for parsing multiple HTTP messages (one message at a time).

The `parser` must efficiently utilize the allocated memory for the following
purposes:

- Provide a mutable buffer for reading raw input (for example, from a socket).
- Store HTTP headers and provide a non-owning, read-only view that allows
  efficient access and iteration through header names and values.
- O(1) access to important HTTP headers, including the request method, target,
  and response status code.
- Store all or part of an HTTP message and provide the necessary interfaces for
  retrieving it.
- Take ownership of user-provided dynamic buffers and sink objects.
- Store the necessary state for inflate algorithms.

Using a `parser` that works with a fixed-size buffer, an application can ensure
it never exceeds capacity if all resources are provisioned at program startup.

== Input Buffer Preparation

The `parser` must use its understanding of the current HTTP message to provide
an input buffer size that balances the number of I/O operations and memory
movements. A naive approach might offer the largest possible buffer to minimize
I/O operations, but this would result in excessive memory movement, consuming
significant computational resources. For example:

- If the exact size of the message body is known and no transformation is
  needed, we can offer an input buffer that matches the remaining body size,
  plus a controlled overread that balances the cost of subsequent memory
  movement.
- If the body type is chunked, we can provide an input buffer that accommodates
  the remaining chunk size, plus a controlled overread to read the next chunk
  header or the terminating chunk. This allows us to position the subsequent
  chunk directly after the current without having to perform memory movement
  due to the existence of a chunk header.

== Two-Phase Parsing  

The parser must return immediately after parsing the header and must not process
the body until the next `parse()` call. For bodiless messages and head
responses, it must transition directly to the `complete_in_place` state after
parsing the header, making further `parse()` calls unnecessary (but still
valid).

This two-phase parsing offers several benefits with almost no complications on
the API usage side:

- It provides an optimization opportunity for users who want to attach a body
  immediately after parsing the header (which is often the case), as there is no
  need to allocate an internal buffer for the message body. This allows all
  available space to be used for the input buffer.
- Since parsing the body might result in an error, returning after parsing the
  header enables users to access the header and, on the next `parse()` call,
  encounter the error.
- Setting the body limit during or after parsing the body doesn’t make much
  sense, so returning immediately after parsing the header provides a window for
  setting such limits.
- If users attach a body immediately after parsing the header, we avoid the
  need for an extra buffer copy operation (in case the user wants to attach an
  elastic buffer).
- The parsed headers remain valid and accessible even if an error occurs during
  body parsing.

== Use Cases and Interfaces

To keep things simple, we will use the following synchronous free functions to
demonstrate the flow of the parse operation in each example:

[source,cpp]
----
void
read_some(stream& s, parser& pr, error_code& ec)
{
    pr.parse(ec);
    if(ec != condition::need_more_input)
        return;

    auto n = s.read_some(pr.prepare(), ec);
    pr.commit(n);
    if(ec == asio::error::eof)
    {
        pr.commit_eof();
        ec = {};
    }
    else if(ec.failed())
    {
        return;
    }

    pr.parse(ec);
}

void
read_header(stream& s, parser& pr)
{
    do
    {
        error_code ec;
        read_some(s, pr, ec);
        if(ec == condition::need_more_input)
            continue;
        if(ec.failed())
            throw system::system_error(ec);
    }
    while(! pr.got_header());
}

void
read(stream& s, parser& pr)
{      
    do
    {
        error_code ec;
        read_some(s, pr, ec);
        if(ec == condition::need_more_input)
            continue;
        if(ec.failed())
            throw system::system_error(ec);
    }
    while(! pr.is_complete());
}
----


=== In-Place Body

It must be possible to use the internal buffer of the `parser` for storing the
entire or part of an HTTP message body.

[source,cpp]
----
request_parser pr{ctx};
pr.start();

read_header(stream, pr);

// When the entire body can fit in-place
read(stream, pr);
string_view body = pr.body();

// When need to read body piece by piece
while(!pr.is_complete())
{
    read_some(stream, pr);
    auto cbs = pr.pull_body();
    pr.consume_body(buffer::buffer_size(cbs));
}
----


=== Sink Body

A `sink`-like body enables algorithms to read body contents directly from the
`parser` 's internal buffer, either in one step or multiple steps, such as when
writing the body to a file. The `parser` takes ownership of the `sink` object,
drives the algorithm, and provides a `ConstBufferSequence` by calling the
relevant virtual interfaces on the `sink`.

[source,cpp]
----
response_parser pr{ctx};
pr.start();

read_header(stream, pr);

http_proto::file file;
system::error_code ec;
file.open("./index.html", file_mode::write_new, ec);
if(ec.failed())
    return ec;

pr.set_body<file_body>(std::move(file));

read(stream, pr);
----


=== Dynamic Buffer

Using the dynamic buffer interface, the `parser` can store body contents
directly into the user-provided buffer or container, avoiding double copying.

[source,cpp]
----
response_parser pr{ctx};
pr.start();

read_header(stream, pr);

std::string body;
pr.set_body(buffers::dynamic_for(body));

read(stream, pr);
----


=== Accessing Buffered Data

The HTTP/1.1 protocol allows upgrading an established connection to a different
protocol by sending an upgrade request and receiving a `101 Switching Protocols`
status code in response. During this process, the `parser` might overread the
HTTP response, such as reading part or all of a WebSocket frame after the
response. The `parser` must provide a way to access this buffered data so it can
be passed to another entity, like a WebSocket stream object.

[source,cpp]
----
response_parser pr{ctx};
pr.start();

read_header(stream, pr);

if(is_upgrade_successful(pr.get()))
{
    auto cbs = pr.buffered_data();
    // Pass the buffered data to the next layer ...
}
