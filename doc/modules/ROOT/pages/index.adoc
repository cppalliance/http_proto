= Boost.HTTP.Proto

This is a portable C++ library offering containers and algorithms for implementing
the HTTP/1.1 protocol. The format is widely used to deliver content on the Internet,
and this implementation adheres strictly to the
https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9110[HTTP/1.1 RFC specification],
henceform referred to as the RFC. The library is distinguished by these
provided features:

* Sans-I/O approach
* Requires only C++11
* Works without exceptions
* Fast compilation, few templates
* Advanced handling of memory (RAM)

== Sans-I/O

While this library implements the HTTP protocol, it does so without performing
any actual network activity as the logic is completely isolated from the
underlying I/O operations. The implementation manages state, ensures RFC
compliance, and provides the application-level interface for building and
inspecting HTTP messages and their payloads, and it is necessary to use or
write the interfacing network implementation on top of HTTP.Proto.

The companion library Boost.HTTP.IO uses Boost.HTTP.Proto to implement network
I/O using Boost.Asio. The
https://sans-io.readthedocs.io/[sans-I/O] website goes into more depth regarding
this innovative approach to designing protocol libraries.

== Requirements

* Requires Boost and a compiler supporting at least C++11
* Link to a static or dynamically linked version of this library
* Supports `-fno-exceptions`, detected automatically

== Tested Compilers

Boost.HTTP.Proto is tested with the following compiler versions:

* gcc: 5 to 14 (except 8.0.1)
* clang: 3.9, 4 to 18
* msvc: 14.1 to 14.42

== Quality Assurance

The development infrastructure for the library includes these per-commit analyses:

* Coverage reports
* Compilation and tests on Drone.io and GitHub Actions

== ABNF

This documentation uses the Augmented
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backus%E2%80%93Naur_form[Backus-Naur Form,window=blank_]
(ABNF) notation of
https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5234[rfc5234,window=blank_]
to specify particular grammars used by algorithms and containers.
While a complete understanding of the notation is not a requirement for using
the library, it may help for an understanding of how valid components of HTTP
messages are defined. In particular, this is of interest to users who wish to
compose parsing algorithms using the combinators provided by the library.

== Acknowledgments

This library wouldn't be where it is today without the help of
https://github.com/pdimov[Peter Dimov,window=blank_]
for design advice and general assistance.
